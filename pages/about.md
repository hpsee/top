This is the site for Digital Records for High Performance Computing

## What is Top?

Every HPC Center wants to have the biggest and baddest clusters. While the 
[TOP500](https://www.top500.org/) holds official status for international centers, 
this leaves out smaller groups that want to participate, and doesn't encompass 
all the kinds of records that might be obtained. As a community developed
and maintained resource, anyone is free to contribute or
update a record in the Digital Book of World Records for HPC.

## How does it work?

Each post in the repository corresponds to one record. For each, we define
a title, and the creation and updated at date (same as the creation date, if the
record is newly added). The content area describes a description of the record, 
followed by a section for each winner. We have three different levels of winners:

 - academic institution
 - national lab
 - corporate entity

This means that each record can have a maximum of three winners.

## Can I contribute a new record?

Yes! Each record is a post (a static file) in the respository, 
and you can simply copy any post to use as a template, and rename with the date and a name for
the record. You can open a pull request to [{{ site.repo }}]({{ site.repo }})
to discuss your contribution.

## Can I update a record?

Competition is good! If you see a record that your center has surpassed, it's up
to you to fix the historical record! You should also open a pull request
to edit the page in question. The previous winners will be remembered
via version control. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask by
[opening an issue]({{ site.repo }}/issues).
