## Institution Record

The [first user-friendly programming language](https://www.concordmonitor.com/BASIC-Dartmouth-Kemeny-time-sharing-historical-26164409), Beginnerâ€™s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC), 
was created at Dartmouth in 1964, and is the first avenue for students across 
domains of study to [be able to do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) scientific computing.
It was developed for the [Dartmouth Time Sharing System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Time_Sharing_System) ([see this emulator](http://www.dtss.org/dtss/)), 
which helped to launch other technologies and even companies along the way. In
addition to recognition from [Dartmouth itself](https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html),
the residents of New Hampshire can now celebrate the creation of BASIC via a new historical
markerm, a sign alongside the highway into Concord, NH.
