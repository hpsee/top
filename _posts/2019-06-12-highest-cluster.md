## Institution Record

In the United States, the cluster with the highest elevation is likely 
University of Wyoming located in Laramie at 7200 feet. The Advanced Research
Computing Center ([ARCC](http://www.uwyo.edu/arcc/)) runs a cluster, [Teton]({{ site.baseurl }}/map/?q=wyoming-teton) that is at the highest elevation. Western State Colorado University sits higher at 7700 feet in Gunnison Colorado, however it's not apparent that there is an HPC center there.
